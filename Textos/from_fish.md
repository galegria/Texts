from fish to bird a long stretch a poem


The river, it's dull metal surface in gelatin revolution, 
the diving killer birds, 
the surprised fish face, 
the spray in my face, 
the spray from within, 
the boat
in a long beautiful curved route 
to pier
to pier
to fear but do any
The military killing birds
diving birds 
but then the face to the other side
slow movement, slow wider than, slow more, slow all

it looks and feels and swallows 
it's old age seed, 
from fish to bird a genetic stretch.
Mothers carrying extravagant creatures
From day one to day now
Bathing old dry fishes and new outlooks
Crushing enterprise, to sail from fish to frown to fuck to free to fly
Bathing suits, the layer of inutility
To want water to excuse from getting wet.
To become sponge
To absorb coming 
To contain 
To expand, contract and reduce.

It, bean sprout
It, root firmly from before seconds
To further away from it, having now to wait 
for the body to realize its own age.
We agree bean sprout
We water bean sprout
Till it is produce and it is the end of the party
Crushing it between knuckles
Some auntie's pearl necklace
They fall like complaints in a no line day
The money stopped being so tired
The apes weren't happy with it
The humans, we're used to it 
You just do it 
You just take possession
You just let it be a problem of scale
The apes swung the sad news like shit
The humans, we're used
To clean it up
Spotless

Bean sprout floats.
Trout happy
Full gull

Nil become the last empire
Least we smile to much all the ugly faces are in need to revel, the grunts
Feast in that air 
annoying everyone with that screeching halt
Having realized, now, you were going to far
To the sea
