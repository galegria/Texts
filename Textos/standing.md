That man has a standing ovation
As it reverberates in the antediluvian hall
He waits for his brake
Time has passed
Enough time it's over
For escape and thank you

All the lamps are yellow white
Dim enough for valleys to look like the plains
All the silverware is scintillating
And it has a song underneath the louder
Conversations

Everyone is playing table talk

Lulled in one corner, 
The old man gives his face rest time

That man is finally sitting down
And no one is collectively looking at him
For now lights give birth to the new yawning material
Deep, hidden material
Yawn so profound it found unburned black oil 
Everyone 
on the corner of their mouths
Had it
The bore.

And also the stare

Mourning the passing of food
A tectonic shift of interest
Multiple servings were going
To make next day subjects
Objects now
